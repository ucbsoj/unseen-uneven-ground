## Instructions

The instructions are in this Google Doc:

This is a pretty straightforward layout, text with some multimedia embeds like video and photos.

Feel free to put placeholders and I'll have the student add the fullres images into the src folder later (instead of extracting images from this Google Doc).

It does have a request for an animating D3 graphic as you scroll. I will help her with this. I'm going to make the D3 graphic self-sufficient, so it will be embedded with an iframe to keep things easy.
